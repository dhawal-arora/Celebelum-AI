# Hacklytics 2024 

In the modern era, students are easily distracted. One of the most used apps among them is Discord. To quickly and efficiently make learning fun again, our bot collects important facts and information from the book of your choice using generative AI to summarize and quiz the user in the celebrity voice of their choice, such as Mr. Beast, Andrew Tate, Millie Bobby Brown, and Donald Trump! It also translates them in multiple languages for various non-native English speakers. This assists students to learn through a different but fun process. You can later see your score and reports to view your progress in terms of charts. This app uses voice recognition and speech, therefore no typing is required.

# Challenges we ran into
Speech recognition through a Discord voice channel was an immensely difficult challenge. Trying to listen, process it, and understand it in bytes was a hassle.
